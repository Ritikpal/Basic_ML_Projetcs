## openCV
Haar Cascade classifier is an effective object detection approach which was proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, “Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features” in 2001. Based on the training it is then used to detect the objects in the other images.
We can use different object detection approach.
 - intall and import openCV
 - Basics of OpenCV (How to read, write and display images)
 - Catching Real-time image from Camera (start webcam and record)
 - Working on images ( blur_image, rgb to grayscale, resize image, crop image)
 - Face recognization using harrcascade_forntalface_default which detect faces in a image.
 - use harrcascade_forntalface-default to recognize/detect faces in video
 - used harrcascade-forntalface_default and haarcascde_eye to detect faces and eyes in real-time.
 - used harrcascade_fullbody to recognize fullbody detection on a video.
